Possibly the best way in the world to protect you from web spam, now fully integrated with phpBB3.

Akismet (for phpBB3) filters out your comment spam for you, so you can focus on more important things.

The way this works (on phpBB3):

	For spam that Akismet catches:
	1. Someone tries to post on your board
	2. Akismet marks the message as spam
	3. Post requires approval by a moderator before continuing

	For ham (false positives) that Akismet catches:
	1. Someone tries to post on your board
	2. Akismet marks the message as spam
	3. Post requires approval by a moderator before continuing
	4. Moderator approves the message and the post is submitted to Akismet as ham (a false positive)

	For spam that Akismet misses:
	1. Someone tries to post on your board
	2. Post shows up in viewtopic
	3. Moderator notices and clicks the "Remove Spam" link on the post
	4. Post is submitted to Akismet as spam and deleted from the board

Features:
